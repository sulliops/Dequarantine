# Dequarantine
Dequarantine is a small macOS application built in SwiftUI that automates the process of removing the "com.apple.quarantine" extended attribute from selected files.

This is useful for files downloaded from the internet, especially `.app` binaries. This application is not intended to facilitate software piracy.
